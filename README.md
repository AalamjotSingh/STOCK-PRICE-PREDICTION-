## Project Overview
This project demonstrates:
- Data retrieval using Yahoo Finance.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on historical stock data.
- Machine learning models to predict stock prices.
- Statistical models like ARIMA for time series forecasting.
- Evaluation of model performance using metrics such as MSE and RÂ².

## Models Used

- Linear Regression: Predicts Close price using Open, High, Low, and Volume.
- Random Forest Regressor: Handles missing values and feature importance. Improved prediction accuracy through hyperparameter tuning.
- ARIMA: Time series forecasting for future prices.
- AdaBoost Regressor: Combines weak predictors to improve prediction accuracy.
